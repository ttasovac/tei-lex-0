    <p>TEI Lex-0 is developed and maintained by an open community of lexicographers, TEI practitioners, and infrastructure partners.</p>
    <p>Preliminary work for the establishment of Lex-0 started in the Working Group
        "Retrodigitised Dictionaries" lead by Toma Tasovac and Vera Hildenbrandt as part of the COST
        Action <ref target="http://www.elexicography.eu">European Network of e-Lexicography</ref>
        (ENeL). Upon the completion of the COST Action, the work on TEI Lex-0 was taken up by the
        DARIAH Working Group "<ref target="#community.dariah-working-group">Lexical
        Resources</ref>". From 2018-2022, the work on TEI Lex-0 was also supported by the
        H2020-funded <ref target="#community.elexis">European Lexicographic Infrastructure</ref>
        (ELEXIS).</p>

    <div xml:id="community.dariah-working-group">
        <head>DARIAH Working Group</head>
        <p>The DARIAH Working Group on Lexical Resources is a self-organized scholarly community
            working under the auspices of the pan-European Digital Research Infrastructure for Arts
            and Humanities (DARIAH-EU). The goals of the WG are: <list>
                <item>to explore, assess and recommend standard tools and methods for the creation,
                    application and dissemination of born-digital and retro-digitized lexical
                    resources (dictionaries, lexicons, thesauri, word lists etc.) as well as other,
                    similar kinds of structured data (gazetteers, almanacs, encyclopaedias etc.);
                    and</item>
                <item>to foster, develop and publicize digitally-enabled lexicographic research from
                    a cross-disciplinary and transnational perspective.</item>
            </list>
        </p>
        <p>The WG focuses on the application and explication of existing standards, both
            onomasiological (TMF, TBX and SKOS) and semasiological (LMF, TEI, and Ontolex); draws
            upon the expertise of various DARIAH partners who are active in this field; and
            collaborates with relevant external projects and associations, such as the European
            Lexicographic Infrastructure (ELEXIS) and CLARIN in order to ascertain the widest
            possible reach of the Working Group’s results.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the WG pursues a strong research-driven agenda on the diversity of
            European lexicographic heritage. In addition to investigating pan-European vocabularies
            and multiple dimensions of lexical borrowing, the working group evaluates current
            practices and formulates guidelines on data enrichment and mutual linking of existing
            electronic dictionaries in view of their common European heritage.</p>
