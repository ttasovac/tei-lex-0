# .github/images

This folder holds images used by GitHub-specific content, such as issue/PR templates, workflow badges, or repository documentation. Keep it for assets that should not be bundled into the published site or build outputs.

For TEI Lex-0 visuals, use `/assets/images` instead (those files are part of the public build).
